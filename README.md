# Downloading the project

1. Create a new, empty folder called opensource/ in your computer's home folder.
2. Navigate to it (`cd opensource`), then fork and clone the vikasUI_PracticeTheme repo so that it gets downloaded into opensource/vikasUI_PracticeTheme.
3. Navigate to this folder (`cd vikasUI_PracticeTheme`) and run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Vikas0786/vikasUI_PracticeTheme.git` (or, if you're using SSH, use `git@github.com:Vikas0786/vikasUI_PracticeTheme.git`) to add an upstream remote that's linked to vikasUI_PracticeTheme's main repository. (This will be necessary when submitting PRs later.)
4. Open index.html in the browser.
